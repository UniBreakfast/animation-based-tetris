## Tetris with smooth animations

#### Ideas for mutators

  - speed (step duration)
  - drop position (center, left, right, random)
  - drop position (glass top, above it, below it)
  - drop delay (with or without suggestion to skip)
  - change in rowCount, columnCount
  - change rotation (clockwise, counter-clockwise, jumping)
  - allow moving up
  - grid integration delay (with sliding, with rotation)
  - allow mole, transformer, shooter, bomb, digger, crumbler
  - allow omino rejection
  - switch between common and uncommon omino sets
  - X similar ominos in a row
  - dig on drop
  - crumble on drop
  - no line clearings for X ominos in a row
  - no line clearings untill X lines are filled
  - combo multiplier change
  - score manipulation
  - grid shift (left, right, up, down)
  - allow sideways movement (left, right)
  - change point of view (omino instead of grid)
  - omino selection change based on grid state
  - omino selection change based of register categories
  - quests (same color shapes, color amount, color combinations)
  - quests (keep omino intact, keep line intact, specific density)
  - color changes (hue, saturation)
  - shape unit changes (texture, borders, style)
  - move to another grid
  - changes in omino selection probability
  - exact filler bonuses, height bonuses, emptiness below bonuses
  - premonition (next X ominos)
  - random changes (in color, holes, position)
  - visual drop targeting
